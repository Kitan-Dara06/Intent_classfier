# Intent_classfier
My intent classifier is a machine learning model designed to understand the purpose or intent behind a user’s input in a conversational system. It’s built using the CLINC150 dataset, which contains various user queries labeled by intent such as book_flight, greet, fun_fact, and oos (out-of-scope).
